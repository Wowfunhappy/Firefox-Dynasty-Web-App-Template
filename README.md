# Firefox-Dynasty-Web-App-Template

Turn websites into apps for legacy OS X. Uses Firefox Dynasty by i3roly: https://github.com/i3roly/firefox-dynasty.

Download the latest version from Releases. This repository is empty because all source code is effectively included in the download, except for the the code to Firefox Dynasty itself—see link above—and the code for the Firefox Modifier library, which can be found [here](https://github.com/Wowfunhappy/Firefox-Dynasty-Downloader-PrefPane).
